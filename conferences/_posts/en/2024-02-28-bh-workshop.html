Almost 100 years after the prediction of general relativity, the existence of black holes has finally been confirmed. The existence of stellar-mass black holes has been confirmed by the detection of gravitational waves, and the existence of supermassive black holes has been confirmed by imaging with the EHT. However, the formation mechanism and growth history of black holes and their relationship with galaxy evolution remain a mystery. In addition, the mechanisms of jet and radiation, and the structures of accretion disks and disk winds have not been elucidated.
In order to break through the current situation To overcome the current situation, it is essential to cooperate with detailed observations by EHT, JWST, IXPE, XRISM, etc., and the latest theoretical studies including numerical simulations. Therefore, we organize a workshop to share recent results on various black holes ranging from stellar-mass black holes to intermediate-mass black holes and supermassive black holes. We would like to provide an opportunity to promote collaborative research through active exchange of ideas.
<br>
This workshop is sponsored by the Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba. This is a joint workshop of "SMBH Research Promotion and Liason Workshop" and "Black-hole jets, accretion discs, and disc-winds workshop". It is also supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (PI: Masayuki Umemura, 19H00697), "Deciphering the origin of supermassive black holes through the comprehensive study of multiple AGNs", and (PI: Ken Ohsuga, 21H04488), "Driving Mechanism and Diversity of Black Hole Jets Revealed by Ultra-Large Scale Computations and Ultra-High Precision Observations". </p>
